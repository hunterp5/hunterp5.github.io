Welcome to my Portfolio Website!

Here is where I upload all my creative endeavors, from photography and art to code projects I have done. This site will be actively managed and improved upon as I gain the skills to do so. Here are some major highlights of the site:

----Built using Bootstrap:
  Has a clean UI and a modern look. I have previously build a site without bootstrap, and I cant see myself not using it. My own styles are applied over the top of the pre-defined Bootstrap styles.
  
----Demonstrates Design Ability:
  I have no background in digital art or design; but I am trying to learn! This is my attempt at creating an attractive and functional site that is both navigable and easy on the eye.
  
----Fully Responsive and Interactive:
  I have added multiple interactive elements that make the website feel more alive. The site also is mobile responsive and looks great on computers, tablets, and phones. 

----Shows a Baseline Knowledge of Scripting:
  JavaScript was used to make some of the more intricate parts of the website work, and PHP was used to handle the "contact me" form. This is my first true integration of these languages into a full project!
  
Thanks for checking out my website! As my coding/programming skills improve, more projects will be added to the site! For now, it is more of a repository for photography and artwork that I have created. Hope you enjoy.
